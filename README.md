# 🔐 CS-App — Cryptography Showcase (Local Demo)

This project is a **local-only demo** of a secure file-sharing system built with **Java**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, designed primarily to **experiment with cryptographic concepts** like:

- 🔑 AES and RSA encryption for files  
- 🛂 2FA with Google Authenticator (TOTP)  
- 🧂 Argon2 password hashing with salt

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project was built for educational purposes around **cryptography**, not for production use. It intentionally **sacrifices accessibility, performance, and security best practices** to prioritize learning.

## 🔒 Features

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Register and log in with 2FA (TOTP + password)
* 🪪 Argon2 password hashing + unique salts
* 📁 Upload/download/transfer files (AES + RSA encrypted)
* 🔔 Notifications when files are shared
* 👫 Friend list with user search and sharing support

## 🚨 Known Issues

This repository contains **known flaws** and should **never be used in production**. Some limitations include:

| Area          | Issue                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 Security   | ❌ No JWT/session handling, No API authentication or rate limitin|
| 📦 Storage    | ❌ Secured files are stored as raw bytes in database                |
| ⏱️ TOTP       | ❌ Has a \~2 second sync lag (no time skew tolerance)               |
| 🖼️ UI        | ❌ No accessibility features, no password masking, minimal feedback |

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

* ✅ [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) + Docker Compose
* ✅ [Java 17+ installed](https://dev.java/download/)

---

### ▶️ Start the App

You can clone the repository or just [download the release V1.0.0](https://github.com/godo0209/cs-app/releases/download/v1.0.0/cs-app-release.zip) (if you downloaded the release please extract the zip into a folder).

>💡 From there you just double click the files `run.bat` or `run.sh` depending on the OS you are using. Then if everything is set up ok a window with a button will appear and you just have to click it. 

The files `run.bat` and `run.sh` ust check if java is installed propertly and exec the file `runproject.jar`, that was created to make things easier and will run the services needed to work. That file will also open the app file for you. But if you prefer manual steps, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/godo0209/cs-app
cd cs-app

# Start backend (MongoDB + API)
docker compose up --build -d

cd demo

# Run the Java client manually
java -jar cs-app.jar
```

## 📘 About This Project

This was a university project focused on **learning modern cryptographic practices** in real-world applications. While it's far from production-ready, it showcases the following:

* Client-server communication
* Data encryption at rest and in transit
* Authentication via passwords + 2FA
* Dockerized local environment
